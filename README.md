## RUFUS Overview

RUFUS is a reference-bias-free, K-mer based variant detection algorithm, for short-read DNA sequence data. RUFUS is intended to run on a high performance computing (HPC) cluster with Apptainer (formerly Singularity) or Docker installed. At a high level, you'll need to download the pre-built container (detailed below) and either use the provided setup script to generate a SLURM script that runs RUFUS or manually create an execution script directly. 

RUFUS calls variants in a single subject against one or more control samples, and currently only accepts GRCh38 as a reference genome. Input files may be FASTQ, CRAM, BAM, or a RUFUS generator file. Where a sample is split across several files, pass each file to the same flag — they are combined into one sample. The reference genome must be in FASTA format, and must be indexed by BWA. If the BWA indexes are not detected in the same directory as the reference genome, RUFUS will create them.

RUFUS has two stages: a variant calling stage, and a post-processing stage. Separation of the stages is necessary because the calling stage may be run in a windowed fashion, requiring multiple parallel RUFUS jobs over all of the windows. The combination stage must wait to proceed until all calling jobs are complete. Algorithmic runtime increases roughly linearly with sample coverage. Generally with whole-genome mode, a 100x sample run will take 1 day. Windowed mode completes significantly faster.


## Running RUFUS

### Obtaining the RUFUS Image

The pre-built RUFUS container is published to two places: Docker Hub, and
[Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13694210) for archival and citation. Either route gives you
the same image.

**From Docker Hub (recommended on HPC).** `apptainer` builds the SIF for you — no `sudo`, no
manual `.def`:
```bash
apptainer pull rufus.sif docker://stefinfection/rufus:latest
apptainer pull rufus.sif docker://stefinfection/rufus:v1.2.0
```
`:latest` always points at the most recent release; pin a specific version instead for a
reproducible analysis. Published versions are listed at
https://hub.docker.com/r/stefinfection/rufus/tags.

**From Zenodo.** The DOI above is a *concept* DOI: it always resolves to the newest release. Zenodo
does not expose a fixed download path for "latest", so ask its API which file to fetch rather than
building a URL by hand — this needs no edits between releases, and is indifferent to the asset being
renamed:
```bash
CONCEPT=13694210   # the concept DOI suffix, 10.5281/zenodo.13694210
URL=$(curl -fsSL --retry 3 --retry-delay 5 "https://zenodo.org/api/records/${CONCEPT}" \
      | python3 -c "import sys,json;print(next(f['links']['self'] for f in json.load(sys.stdin)['files'] if f['key'].endswith('.sif')))")
[ -n "$URL" ] || { echo "could not resolve the latest RUFUS SIF from Zenodo" >&2; exit 1; }
curl -fL --retry 3 --retry-delay 5 -o rufus.sif "$URL"
```
The `-f` and the emptiness check matter: Zenodo's API intermittently returns 504s, and without
them a failed lookup silently leaves you with a truncated or empty `rufus.sif`. If it keeps
failing, the Docker Hub route above is the more reliable one.

To browse releases instead, https://zenodo.org/records/13694210/latest opens the newest one.

### Input Data

RUFUS requires the following data to run:
1) A subject sample in FASTQ/BAM/CRAM/generator format. BAM/CRAM may be unaligned when using whole genome mode; FASTQ is whole-genome only and cannot be combined with `-R/--region`. If the sample is split across several files, pass `-s` once per file — they are treated as one sample, not as separate subjects.
2) At least one of: one or more control samples (`-c`, same formats as the subject), or an exclude hash (`-e`). Multiple distinct controls are supported, e.g. mother and father for a trio. Supplying only `-e` — typically pre-built 1000G/control hashes — is single-sample mode.
3) A reference fasta file (this must be indexed by BWA) - for use in reporting the called variants. *It's recommended to provide the BWA indexes in the same directory as the reference to save time creating them during the RUFUS run.*\
\
To create the BWA indexes, run the following commands:
   ```
   bwa index -a bwtsw {REFERENCE.fa}
   samtools faidx {REFERENCE.fa}
   ```

All input files are specified by their full paths. The necessary host directories are automatically bind-mounted into the Apptainer container.

### Output Data

RUFUS will, by default, output the following files *in the current working directory*:
1) A VCF file containing the called variants
2) A supplemental directory with:
    * A pre-filtered VCF file
    * A BAM file containing the raw reads containing the mutant kmers
    * A BAM file containing the assembled contigs from the raw reads containing the mutant kmers
    * A hash table containing the unique subject kmers and their counts
3) In windowed (region) mode, a `region_status.log` file summarizing the outcome of each region (variants called, no variants found with reason, or error with exit code)

 
### The Two Stages of RUFUS

RUFUS has two execution stages:
1) The calling stage, invoked by the following
```
apptainer exec {PATH_TO_RUFUS_CONTAINER}/rufus.sif bash /opt/RUFUS/runRufus.sh [-s|--subject <arg>] [-r|--ref <arg>] [-t|--threads <arg>] [-k|--kmersize <arg>] [-m|--min <arg>] [-h|--help] [-c|<controls-1>] ... [-c|<controls-n>] ...OPTIONS
```
With the following usage:
```
Required Arguments:
    -s,--subject: bam/cram/fastq/generator file(s) containing the subject of interest. Use multiple times only for split files of the SAME sample (e.g. -s subject.part1.bam -s subject.part2.bam); they are combined into one subject, not called separately
    -r,--ref: file path to the desired reference file
    -t,--threads: number of threads to use (min 3)

Optional Arguments:
    -c,--controls: bam/cram/fastq/generator file(s) for the sequence data of a control sample (can be used multiple times for distinct controls, e.g. -c mother.bam -c father.bam). NOTE: optional only if -e/--exclude is supplied instead — RUFUS requires at least one control or exclude source and will exit if given neither. Supplying only -e is single-sample mode
    -k,--kmersize: length of k-mer to use (defaults to 25)
    -m,--min: overwrites the minimum k-mer depth count to call variant (defaults to 5)
    -e,--exclude: Jhash file of kmers to exclude from mutation list (can be used multiple times, e.g. -e Jhash1 -e Jhash2)
    -f,--refhash: Jhash file containing reference hashList
    -R,--region: genomic region to call variants on (e.g., chr1:1-1000000); used in windowed mode
    -h,--help: Print help
```

2) The post-processing stage, invoked by the following
```
apptainer exec {PATH_TO_RUFUS_CONTAINER}/rufus.sif bash /opt/RUFUS/post_process/post_process.sh -s <subject> -w <window_size>
```
With the following usage:
```
Required Arguments:
    -s subject_file  The name of the subject file: must be the same as that supplied to the RUFUS run
    -w window_size   The size of the window used in the RUFUS run (0 for whole genome mode)
Optional Arguments:
    -h help  Print help message
```

In windowed mode, the post-processing stage will print a region status summary showing how many regions called variants, how many had no variants (with breakdown by reason), and how many encountered errors. The final VCF header will include a `##RUFUS_runMode` line indicating region mode was used.


## Using the SLURM Helper Script & Executing the SLURM Batch Scripts

The SLURM helper script automatically creates the two SLURM batch scripts necessary to run RUFUS on a SLURM-managed HPC cluster, as well as a bash script to execute them. To use:
1) Execute the helper script (see full usage options below):
``` 
apptainer exec {PATH_TO_RUFUS_CONTAINER}/rufus.sif bash /opt/RUFUS/singularity/setup_slurm.sh [-s subject] [-c control1,control2,control3...] [-b genome_build] [-a slurm_account] [-p slurm_partition] ...OPTIONS
```

2) Then execute the generated bash script:
```
bash launch_rufus.sh
```

The full usage options for the helper script are as follows:
```
Required Arguments:
    -s subject    Full path to the subject sample BAM/CRAM
    -b genome_build  The desired genome build; currently only supports GRCh38
    -r reference  Full path to the reference file matching the genome build
    -a slurm_account  The account for the slurm job
    -p slurm_partition    The partition for the slurm job
    -l slurm_job_array_limit    The maximum amount of jobs slurm allows in an array
    
Optional Arguments:
    -c control(s) A single control or comma-delimited array of multiple controls (full paths).
                  Omit for single-sample mode, in which case you must supply a hash source
                  instead -- see "Single-sample mode" below
    -m kmer_depth_cutoff  The amount of kMers that must overlap the variant to be included in the final call set
    -w window_size    The size of the windows to run RUFUS on, in units of kilabases (KB); allowed range between 500-5000; defaults to single run of entire genome if not provided
    -f reference_hash   Jhash file containing reference kMer hash list
    -x exclude_hash     Single or comma-delimited list of Jhash file(s) containing kMers to exclude (static, same for all regions)
    -K kg1_hash_dir     Full path to directory of per-region KG1 Jhash files (files named *{region}*.Jhash)
    -G kg1_version      KG1 hash version to download from S3 (e.g., v3.0)
    -D ctrl_hash_dir    Full path to directory of per-region control Jhash files (files named *{region}*.Jhash)
    -V ctrl_version     Control hash version to download from S3 (e.g., v1.0)
    -M memory_per_call  How much memory to allot to the rufus calling stage job (e.g., 150G or 20G)
    -C cpus_per_call    How many cpus to allot to each rufus calling stage job; defaults to 40 for
                        whole genome, 12 for 1MB windows. Must be greater than the RUFUS thread
                        count (-z), or setup will exit with an error
    -y path_to_rufus_container   If not provided, will look in current directory for rufus.sif
    -z rufus_threads  Number of threads provided to RUFUS; defaults to 36 for entire genome; 10 for 1MB windows
    -e email  The email address to notify with slurm updates
    -q slurm_job_queue_limit    The maximum amount of jobs able to be ran at once; defaults to 20
    -t slurm_time_limit   The maximum amount of time to let the slurm job run; defaults to 7 days for full run, or one hour per window (DD-HH:MM:SS)
    -h help   Print usage
```
\
*Notes on SLURM arguments*:\
This script utilizes SLURM arrays to batch RUFUS call runs and thus requires the SLURM job array limit to comply with user settings. To find your SLURM job array limit:
```
scontrol show config | grep "MaxArraySize"
```

To maximize parallelism, filling in the slurm job queue limit (-q) is recommended. You can find your limit by typing:
```
scontrol show config | grep "default_queue_depth"
```

#### Example Invocations of the helper script

Basic windowed mode:
```
apptainer exec /home/my_container_path/rufus.sif bash /opt/RUFUS/singularity/setup_slurm.sh -s /home/subjects/subject.bam -c /home/controls/control_a.bam,/home/controls/control_b.bam -r /refs/GRCh38_reference.fa -a my-slurm-account -p my-slurm-partition -w 1000 -t "00:30:00" -m 5 -l 20 -z 36 -e "my_email@utah.edu"
```

With local per-region hash directories:
```
apptainer exec /home/my_container_path/rufus.sif bash /opt/RUFUS/singularity/setup_slurm.sh -s /home/subjects/subject.bam -c /home/controls/control_a.bam -r /refs/GRCh38_reference.fa -a my-slurm-account -p my-slurm-partition -w 1000 -l 1000 -K /data/kg1_hashes/v3.0/ -D /data/ctrl_hashes/v1.0/
```

With S3-downloaded hashes (downloaded at setup time):
```
apptainer exec /home/my_container_path/rufus.sif bash /opt/RUFUS/singularity/setup_slurm.sh -s /home/subjects/subject.bam -c /home/controls/control_a.bam -r /refs/GRCh38_reference.fa -a my-slurm-account -p my-slurm-partition -w 1000 -l 1000 -G v3.0 -V v1.0
```

#### Single-sample mode

RUFUS does not require a matched control. If you have no control sample, omit `-c` and supply a
pre-built k-mer hash source instead — RUFUS subtracts against those hashes rather than against a
control you sequenced. Any of `-x`, `-K`/`-G`, or `-D`/`-V` satisfies this; they are passed through
to the calling stage as `-e/--exclude` arguments.

You must supply at least one of a control or a hash source. Providing neither is rejected at the
start of the calling stage.

Single-sample, windowed, with S3-downloaded 1000 Genomes and control hashes:
```
apptainer exec /home/my_container_path/rufus.sif bash /opt/RUFUS/singularity/setup_slurm.sh -s /home/subjects/subject.bam -r /refs/GRCh38_reference.fa -a my-slurm-account -p my-slurm-partition -b GRCh38 -w 1000 -l 1000 -G v3.0 -V v1.0
```

The same run against hash directories you already hold locally:
```
apptainer exec /home/my_container_path/rufus.sif bash /opt/RUFUS/singularity/setup_slurm.sh -s /home/subjects/subject.bam -r /refs/GRCh38_reference.fa -a my-slurm-account -p my-slurm-partition -b GRCh38 -w 1000 -l 1000 -K /data/kg1_hashes/v3.0/ -D /data/ctrl_hashes/v1.0/
```

*Note*: `-K`/`-G` (KG1 hashes) and `-D`/`-V` (control hashes) are mutually exclusive per type. You may mix local and S3 across types (e.g., `-K /local/kg1/ -V v1.0`). Hash files in local directories must be named with the region string (e.g., `*chr1_1_1000000*.Jhash` for region `chr1:1-1000000`, or `*wg*.Jhash` for whole-genome mode).
