# Despite it's name, this is the only script currently utilized by RUFUS, despite any mode. When speed is true, veryfast
# mode is used.
#
# veryfast mode consists of the following criteria:
# 1. Reads going into OverlapSam are filtered by length - must be 150bp or shorter
# 2. OverlapSam is run with the following parameters:
#   a. Min Percentage is 99%
#   b. Min Overlap is 25bp
#   c. Min Coverage is 3bp
#
# normal mode consists of the following criteria:
# 1. OverlapSame is run with the following parameters:
#   a. Min Percentage is 95%
#   b. Min Overlap is 20bp
#   c. Min Coverage is 1bp
