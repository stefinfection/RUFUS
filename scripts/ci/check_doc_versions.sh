#   check_doc_versions.sh            verify (exit 1 on drift) -- this is what CI runs
#   check_doc_versions.sh --write    rewrite the managed spots to match globals.txt
#
# Most places that need the version can just derive it (docs/publish_new_sif.md reads
# globals.txt inline, and the workflow extracts it the same way). Only user-facing text
# that is read outside a checkout -- i.e. README.md -- has to carry a literal, so only
# those spots are managed here. Each rule is an explicit anchor plus the expected
# rendering, so this can never false-positive on a deliberate historical reference to an
# older version.
#
# TODO(after the first successful v* release): this file can largely go away. The reason
# README carries a version at all is that the Zenodo asset is uploaded as
# rufus_<version>.sif (scripts/ci/zenodo_upload.sh takes `basename "$SIF_PATH"`), so both
# the record id and the filename move every release. Publishing the asset under a stable
# name (rufus.sif) against the concept record -- which always resolves to the latest
# version -- makes the download URL permanent and removes the drift at its source. That
# change touches the release job, which has never executed, so it is deliberately NOT
# being made before the release that first exercises it.
